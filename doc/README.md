# Osmose-QA Backend

This documentation is for understand how Osmose-QA Backend works. With the main goal to modify or add new validations rules.

This documentation is written in Markdown and in Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook are interactive shell for learn and test code. Nevertheless, and like the Markdown part, it could be accessed as static view [online at Github](https://github.com/osm-fr/osmose-backend/tree/master/doc). If you want to run the Jupyter Notebook in interactive mode, follow the [installation with Docker](../docker/README.md).
